# Ruby/Sapphire Style Player Avatar Option

## Overview

This PR adds the ability for players to choose between Emerald-style or Ruby/Sapphire (Classic) style player sprites. The option is available during new game creation and can be changed anytime via the options menu.

## Feature Description

### Player Style Selection

Players can choose their avatar style at two points:

1. **New Game** - After selecting gender, a new "Look" selection screen appears
2. **Options Menu** - A "PLAYER STYLE" option is available in the World options

### Style Options

| Style | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Emerald | Default Emerald protagonist sprites (Brendan/May) |
| Classic | Ruby/Sapphire style protagonist sprites |

The style affects:
- Overworld sprites (walking, running, biking, surfing, etc.)
- Battle back sprites
- Trainer card portrait
- Region map player icon

## Technical Implementation

### Storage

The player's style choice is stored using `FLAG_PLAYER_STYLE_RS` (repurposed from unused flag 0x296).

```c
// Check current style
if (FlagGet(FLAG_PLAYER_STYLE_RS))
    // Use RS/Classic sprites
else
    // Use Emerald sprites

// Set style
FlagSet(FLAG_PLAYER_STYLE_RS);   // RS/Classic
FlagClear(FLAG_PLAYER_STYLE_RS); // Emerald
```

Note: The initial implementation used a new SaveBlock2 field, but this was changed to use an existing unused flag to avoid modifying the save structure.
